Ques: How many request requite to upload a folder in AWS S3?



It is not possible to determine the exact number of PUT requests needed to upload a folder to S3 without more context. The number of `PUT` requests needed will depend on the size and structure of the folder, as well as the specific method used to upload the folder and the specific S3 configuration and transfer settings being used..

For example, if you are using the AWS CLI to upload a folder to S3, you can use the `aws s3 sync` command, which will automatically split the files in the folder into multiple PUT requests as needed. Alternatively, you could use the `aws s3 cp` command, which allows you to specify a `--recursive` flag to upload all files and subfolders within a specified folder. In this case, the number of PUT requests would depend on the number of files and subfolders in the folder.

It is also possible to use the AWS SDKs or the S3 REST API to programmatically upload a folder to S3. In these cases, the number of `PUT` requests needed would again depend on the size and structure of the folder, as well as the specific method and parameters used in the API call.


In general, **uploading a folder to S3 will require at least one PUT request for each file within the folder**. However, depending on the size of the files and the specific method used to upload them, it is possible that additional PUT requests may be required to complete the upload process

It's is possible to use **multi-part** uploads to reduce the number of `PUT` requests required for larger files, you can use the AWS SDKs or AWS CLI to perform a **multipart** upload, which can potentially reduce the number of PUT requests required.

Consideration:
--------------

There are several ways to upload a file to an S3 bucket:

Using the Amazon S3 console: This is a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily upload files to your S3 bucket.

1. **Using the AWS CLI:** The AWS command line interface allows you to upload files to S3 from the command line. 

     >- `aws s3 cp:` This command allows you to copy a file from a local file system to an S3 bucket, or vice versa. example ...
     >  
     >      ```Shell
     >      aws s3 cp /path/to/local/file s3://my-bucket/path/to/remote/file
     >      ```
     >      OR
     >  
     >     ```Shell
     >     aws s3 cp /path/to/local/directory s3://my-bucket/path/to/remote/directory --recursive
     >     ```
     >
     >- `aws s3 sync:` This command allows you to synchronize the contents of a local directory with an S3 bucket, uploading any new or modified files or vice versa, example ...
     >     aws s3 sync /path/to/local/directory s3://my- 
     >bucket/path/to/remote/directory
     >- `aws s3api put-object:` This command allows you to upload a file/object to an S3 bucket using the S3 REST API.
     >- `aws s3api upload-part:` This command allows you to upload a part of a multipart upload to an S3 bucket.
     >- `aws s3api upload-part-copy:` This command allows you to copy a part of an object and upload it to an S3 bucket as a part of a multipart upload.
     > - `aws s3 mv:` This command allows you to move a local file to an S3 bucket, or to move a file within an S3 bucket to a different location.
     >- `aws s3upload:` This command is part of the AWS SAM CLI and allows you to upload a local file or directory to an S3 bucket, with options to specify the bucket name, key prefix, and other parameters.

2. **Using the AWS SDKs:** The AWS software development kits provide libraries for various programming languages that allow you to upload files to S3 from your code.

3. **Using third-party tools:** There are many third-party tools available that allow you to easily upload files to S3, such as CloudBerry Explorer or S3 Browser.

4. **Using the S3 REST API:** You can use the S3 REST API to programmatically upload files to S3 using HTTP requests.

5. **Using the AWS Transfer Family:** You can use AWS Transfer Family to upload files to an S3 bucket using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), or the Network File System (NFS). This option is useful if you want to use a familiar file transfer protocol to transfer files to an S3 bucket.

**There are several other considerations to keep in mind when using the PUT operation to upload a file to an Amazon S3 bucket:**

> `Object size:` S3 has a maximum object size of 5 TB. If you are trying to upload a file larger than this, you will need to use the Multipart Upload API. However, for optimal performance, it is recommended to keep the size of individual objects below 100 MB.
> 
> `File name:` S3 has a minimum file name length of 1 character and a maximum file name length of 1024 characters. The file name must also be unique within the bucket.
> 
> `File format:` S3 supports a wide range of file formats, including text, binary, and multimedia files. However, certain file formats may not be supported or may require additional processing before they can be used.
> 
> `Metadata:` You can specify metadata for your objects when uploading them to S3. This metadata is stored with the object and can be used to provide additional information about the object.
> 
> `Access controls:` You can use access controls, such as bucket policies and IAM policies, to control who can access your objects in S3.
> 
> `Data consistency:` S3 provides read-after-write consistency for PUTs of new objects and eventual consistency for overwrite PUTs and DELETEs. This means that immediately after a new object is added to a bucket, it may not be available for read operations.
> 
> `Cost:` S3 charges fees for storing and accessing objects in your bucket. You should consider these costs when uploading and storing objects in S3.
> 
> `Error handling:` It is important to handle errors gracefully when uploading objects to an S3 bucket using the PUT operation. For example, you should consider retrying the PUT operation in the event of a network error or server-side issue.
> 
> `Transfer acceleration:` S3 Transfer Acceleration allows you to upload files to S3 over the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network (CDN), which can significantly reduce the time it takes to transfer large files over long distances. Transfer acceleration is especially useful for uploading large files from locations with a slow internet connection.

By keeping these considerations in mind, you can ensure that your S3 PUT operations are successful and efficient.

**Another Question ? Is there any cap on the S3 put request?**

There is no fixed limit on the number of put requests that you can make to an Amazon `S3` bucket. However, there are limits on the rate at which you can make put requests to an S3 bucket. These limits are known as `request rate` or `request throttling` limits, and they are set at the level of the S3 bucket or the AWS account.

The request rate limits for `S3` vary depending on the region and the type of `S3 storage class`. For example, in the US East (N. Virginia) region, the request rate limit for the S3 Standard storage class is 3,000 put requests per second per bucket. This means that you can make up to 3,000 put requests per second to a single S3 bucket in this region.

If you exceed the request rate limit for an S3 bucket, your put requests will be throttled and you will receive an `HTTP error code 503 (Service Unavailable)`. To avoid request throttling, you can design your application to handle `request retries` and `backoff`.

It's important to note that these request rate limits are set at the level of the bucket, so if you have multiple objects being written to the same bucket simultaneously, those writes will count towards the same request rate limit. If you need to write a large number of objects to S3, you can consider using the `Multipart Upload API`, which allows you to upload large objects in parallel and can improve the upload speed.

For more information about S3 request rate limits and how to handle request throttling, you can refer to the Amazon S3 documentation.

**How AWS `S3` put works behind the scene?**

When you use the `aws s3api put-object` command or the `aws s3 cp` command to upload a file to an Amazon S3 bucket, the following steps occur behind the scenes:

> The AWS CLI sends an `HTTP PUT` request to the S3 REST API.
>
> The S3 REST API receives the `PUT` request and processes it.
> 
> S3 stores the uploaded file in the specified bucket and location.
> 
> S3 returns an HTTP response to the AWS CLI, indicating the status of the PUT request (e.g. `200 OK` if the request was successful).
> 
> The AWS CLI displays the HTTP response to the user.

> In the background, S3 stores the uploaded file as an object within the bucket. An object consists of the file data, metadata (such as the file name, content type, and access controls), and a unique identifier called the `object key`.

> S3 stores objects in a highly durable and available manner, using redundant storage across multiple servers and facilities. This ensures that the uploaded file is safe and can be retrieved at any time.

For more information about how Amazon S3 stores and manages objects, you can refer to the Amazon S3 documentation.
